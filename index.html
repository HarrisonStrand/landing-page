      <h2>Week 1 Projects</h2>
      <li>
        <a href="https://harrisonstrand.github.io/my-first-webpage/" target="_blank">My First Webpage</a>
      </li>
        <p>This was my first attempt at creating a webpage using HTML and a little bit of CSS. I created live links to navigate to my favorite things and places, as well as to navigate to the Epicodus home page.
        </p>
          <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/cupcake-website.git" target="_blank">SPRANKLZ</a>
      </li>
        <p>This was a very fun collaborative project making a mock cupcake website. We used HTML to write a description and title of our website, and then CSS to style the color of text and align all of our cupcake picture examples.
        </p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/Animal-Shelter.git" target="_blank">Animal Shelter</a>
      </li>
        <p>In this project, my partners and I created a mock pet adoption site with exotic animals and a little back story about them using HTML and CSS. We learned about floating and different types of alignment to section each animal in a list with a corresponding picture next to the description.
        </p>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/wiki.git" target="_blank">Recreating Wikipedia</a>
      </li>
        <p>This project was a major challenge for us new devs. We tried our best to recreate the Wikipedia homepage with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We created and aligned a navigation bar as well as specified links for our top nav row. It was very interesting comparing code and seeing how complicated certain professional and stable proffesional websites can be.
        </p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/week-in-review.git" target="_blank">Bootstrap Practice</a>
      </li>
        <p>When the week was almost done, we followed along in a lesson to see all of the amazing things that bootstrap can do to style and polish your HTML file. This was a great example of trying out different bootstrap alerts and colors, as well as different ways to contain elements in your project.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I've been living in Portland for a little over 8 years and love it here, but Boise is always the place that i consider home. I spent the first part of my life in such a wonderful place, exploring the outdoors in Idaho's amazing mountains and meadows, really developing my internal need for adventure and freedom. I adore, and will continue to adore the landscapes and calmness that is Idaho, but have definitely outgrown the city of Boise as a whole. My decision to move to Portland was one of the best in my life, and it was all made on a flip of a coin and two weeks preparation. Heads was Portland, tails was Seattle, so my roomates and the time and I packed our bags to move to this magical city and never looked back. Every year I always make time to visit my family in Boise and the few in Seattle so the holidays are more or less a family reunion. 
      <br>
      I have grown so much as a person and as a professional here in Portland being around the art, the incredible people and especially the food (and yes I mean both types of "growth", I love the food here). Starting my journey to figure out my goals and where my passions and strengths lay has been an evergrowing challenge, but I cannot wait for what year 9 has in store for me.

    <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I moved to Portland shortly after graduating high school with the hope that this city would create more opportunities for me as a person who loves adventure, and for my progression into the professional realm, and boy did I luck out.
      <br>
      I've been working in the restaurant industry since I was 15 and have learned the importance of focus and patience, constantly learning new things and applying them to every new challenge. I've been bartending in Portland for about 6 years with the hope that it would help me fine tune my learning skills and hopefully bridge the gap into future goals and the career of my choosing.
      <br>
      I decided to get into programming after a lot of research and some small intro classes, knowing that it woud be something worthwhile for me to put my hard work and saving into. I've always been comfortable in front of the computer from a young age, making music on Digital Audio Workspaces, so using that comfort in a new way and a new language seemed very much in the right direction for my goals.
