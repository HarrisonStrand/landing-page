      <h2>Week 1 Projects</h2>
      <li>
        <a href="https://harrisonstrand.github.io/my-first-webpage/" target="_blank">My First Webpage</a>
      </li>
        <p>This was my first attempt at creating a webpage using HTML and a little bit of CSS. I created live links to navigate to my favorite things and places, as well as to navigate to the Epicodus home page.
        </p>
          <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/cupcake-website.git" target="_blank">SPRANKLZ</a>
      </li>
        <p>This was a very fun collaborative project making a mock cupcake website. We used HTML to write a description and title of our website, and then CSS to style the color of text and align all of our cupcake picture examples.
        </p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/Animal-Shelter.git" target="_blank">Animal Shelter</a>
      </li>
        <p>In this project, my partners and I created a mock pet adoption site with exotic animals and a little back story about them using HTML and CSS. We learned about floating and different types of alignment to section each animal in a list with a corresponding picture next to the description.
        </p>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/wiki.git" target="_blank">Recreating Wikipedia</a>
      </li>
        <p>This project was a major challenge for us new devs. We tried our best to recreate the Wikipedia homepage with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We created and aligned a navigation bar as well as specified links for our top nav row. It was very interesting comparing code and seeing how complicated certain professional and stable proffesional websites can be.
        </p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/week-in-review.git" target="_blank">Bootstrap Practice</a>
      </li>
        <p>When the week was almost done, we followed along in a lesson to see all of the amazing things that bootstrap can do to style and polish your HTML file. This was a great example of trying out different bootstrap alerts and colors, as well as different ways to contain elements in your project.
