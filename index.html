      <h2>Week 1 Projects</h2>
      <li>
        <a href="https://harrisonstrand.github.io/my-first-webpage/" target="_blank">My First Webpage</a>
      </li>
        <p>This was my first attempt at creating a webpage using HTML and a little bit of CSS. I created live links to navigate to my favorite things and places, as well as to navigate to the Epicodus home page.</p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/cupcake-website.git" target="_blank">SPRANKLZ</a>
      </li>
        <p>This was a very fun collaborative project making a mock cupcake website. We used HTML to write a description and title of our website, and then CSS to style the color of text and align all of our cupcake picture examples.</p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/Animal-Shelter.git" target="_blank">Animals Bizzare</a>
      </li>
        <p>In this project, my partners and I created a mock pet adoption site with exotic animals and a little back story about them using HTML and CSS. We learned about floating and different types of alignment to section each animal in a list with a corresponding picture next to the description.</p>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/wiki.git" target="_blank">Recreating Wikipedia</a>
      </li>
        <p>This project was a major challenge for us new devs. We tried our best to recreate the Wikipedia homepage with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We created and aligned a navigation bar as well as specified links for our top nav row. It was very interesting comparing code and seeing how complicated certain professional and stable proffesional websites can be.</p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonStrand/week-in-review.git" target="_blank">Bootstrap Practice</a>
      </li>
        <p>When the week was almost done, we followed along in a lesson to see all of the amazing things that bootstrap can do to style and polish your HTML file. This was a great example of trying out different bootstrap alerts and colors, as well as different ways to contain elements in your project.</p>

          <h3><span class="extra">About Me</span></h3>
              <p>I've been living in Portland for a little over 8 years and love it here, but Boise is always the place that i consider home. I spent the first part of my life in such a wonderful place, exploring the outdoors in Idaho's amazing mountains and meadows, really developing my internal need for adventure and freedom. I adore, and will continue to adore the landscapes and calmness that is Idaho, but have definitely outgrown the city of Boise as a whole. My decision to move to Portland was one of the best in my life, and it was all made on a flip of a coin and two weeks preparation. Heads was Portland, tails was Seattle, so my roomates and the time and I packed our bags to move to this magical city and never looked back. Every year I always make time to visit my family in Boise and the few in Seattle so the holidays are more or less a family reunion.</p>
              <p>Portland has helped me grow so much as a person and a as a professional, being around the art, the incredible people and especially the food (and yes I mean both types of "growth", I love the food almost too much here). Starting my journey to figure out my goals and where my passions and strengths lay has been an evergrowing challenge, but I cannot wait for what year 9 has in store for me. </p>

          <h3><span class="extra2">Background</span></h3>
              <p>I moved to Portland shortly after graduating high school with the hope that this city would create more opportunities for me as a person who loves adventure, and for my progression into the professional realm, and boy did I luck out.</p>

              <p>Working in the restaurant industry since I was 15, I have learned the importance of focus and patience, constantly learning new things and applying them to every new challenge. I've been bartending in Portland for about 6 years with the hope that it would help me fine tune my learning skills and hopefully bridge the gap into future goals and the career of my choosing.</p>

              <p>After a lot of research and some small intro classes, I got into programming, knowing that it woud be something worthwhile for me to put my hard work and saving into. I've always been comfortable in front of the computer from a young age, making music on Digital Audio Workspaces, so using that comfort in a new way and a new language seemed very much in the right direction for my goals.</p>

          <h3><span class="extra2">Interests/Skills</span></h3>
            <p>Music has always been a significant interest in my life since I was a kid. I started playing the drums at 14, the guitar and bass at 16, but felt very limited to the amount of sounds that I could make to compose with. My introduction into the electronic music world, working with synthesizers and computer generated sound started around 20 when I began working with Ableton. I quickly realized that all of the limitations of sound with physical instruments was abolished as I developed my skill making different tones and algorithmic based sounds.</p>
            <p>Music production for the last couple of years has consumed most of my time and energy, making different melodies and composing full songs. <strong>Eat, sleep, music repeat.</strong> Getting into programming on top of that has helped me realize that I can develop my skills to create the same type of programs that I've been using all of these years to create sounds and textures which has sparked a huge interest for me in the dev world. My thought is that the electronic music world and working with specific computer programs for hours on end, has helped me develop certain skills to bridge the gap into the program developing world.</p>
